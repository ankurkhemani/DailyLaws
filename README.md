DAILY LAWS (OPEN SOURCE ANDROID APP) - Please fork the project and provide further contributions! :)

Along with my lawyer friend Parth Chandra, I created this project called "Daily Laws" specially designed to educate people in India about the Indian laws and provide legal solutions to common problems we encounter in daily life. This was highly endorsed by Indian media and the app featured in many top articles.

The app is live on Google Play Store - https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mindgames.dailylaw
